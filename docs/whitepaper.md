## The Multiverse of greg
greg and many of his derived characters span across the NFT multiverse and Twitter. The various characters are operated by anonymous users, who may or may not own matching Multiverse Tokens. Twitter's hexagonal NFT profile picture can make it easy for new and existing greg characters to assimilate in the multiverse. The greg account is more likely to interact with "official" greg characters.

greg-derived characters often interact with the greg account, with each other, and with some of the Twitter accounts greg is known to engage with. The more characters are actively involved, the easier it will be for the multiverse to expand.
